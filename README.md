# BlackOut
- BlackOut is a console based chat application , which uses tor hidden service and AES encryption to provide anonymity to those in needs
- Its whole design and idea is based on p2p networking where every user is server and client themselves.

# Whats and why p2p?
- This application will be distributed as standalone exe , and p2p will support more privacy, as there will not be any specific server on which everything is hosted
- the communication will be faster and direct, while more private and anonymous

# NOTE
- Further version, will introduce the functionality of p2p and other such as admin, and authentication from the room creator to enter the room.
